# AI Follower Framework Server

Server for the Skyrim mod "AI Follower Framework". This component serves as a bridge between the SKSE plugin and various AI providers of text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and AI-based chat generators such as ChatGPT, MeloTTS, koboldcpp, Openrouter, XTTS, etc.

Ultimately you will have meaningful interactions with AI NPCs. 

## Other Features:
- Any NPC can be an AI, including group conversations.
- Long-term memory for in-game characters, employing various techniques to mitigate the lack of long-term memory in current LLMs (Language Model Models).
- Deep world awareness.
- An AI Narrator to narrate your adventures and provide help.
- Function calling action commands (e.g., trade with me, move here, attack that monster, etc.).
- Dynamic character personalities that update over your playthrough.
