This divine protection ensures that the dead cannot be raised as undead. Necromancers see Arkay as their greatest foe, as his followers are dedicated to stopping the profane manipulation of mortal souls.  Arkay’s worship is widespread across Tamriel, from the Bretons, who believe he was once a mortal granted godhood by Mara, to the Nords, where he has replaced the older figure of Orkey. Redguards see him as a guide of souls through life and death, while Bosmer invoke him in matters concerning the Green Pact.

Worship of Julianos is prevalent in the Imperial City, where a Chantry is dedicated to him, as well as in the Iliac Bay region, where his temples are called Schools of Julianos, functioning as centers of education. The ancient Nords once worshipped him as Jhunal, the father of language and mathematics, before he became part of the Divines under the name Julianos. He is the patron of several regions, including Lainlyn and Satakalaam, and remains a respected figure for those seeking justice and knowledge.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('lorkhan', 'Lorkhan, also known as the Missing God, is a central figure in Tamrielic myth, often regarded as the Creator, Trickster, and Tester of mortals. Revered and reviled, Lorkhan''s influence is woven into every culture’s mythology, and he is credited with initiating the creation of the mortal plane, Nirn. He convinced the et''Ada, the Original Spirits, to create Mundus, the world, disrupting the cosmic order. Following the world''s creation, Lorkhan was separated from his divine essence—most commonly through the removal of his Heart—and exiled from the divine realm. This event, referred to as the "shattering of Lorkhan," is depicted as a punishment for his role in the creation of the flawed mortal realm, though some legends suggest he willingly accepted this fate.  The perceptions of Lorkhan vary greatly between different races. To the Elves, he is a deceiver responsible for trapping them in the mortal realm, severing their connection to the spiritual plane. The Altmer view him as the ultimate antagonist, a being who imprisoned them in a world of suffering and limitation. Conversely, humans, especially Nords and Imperials, honor him as a heroic figure. In Skyrim, he is worshipped as Shor, the god who sacrificed himself to create the world. Redguards know him as Sep, a trickster who helped shape the mortal world but was cursed for his transgressions. Reachmen revere him as the Spirit of Man, while Khajiit associate him with Lorkhaj, the Moon Beast, whose heart''s corruption birthed the dark dro-m’Athra.

He was known for his strength and leadership, often depicted holding his sword, Penitent (Vosh Rakh, the "Blade of Courage"). Trinimac was especially venerated by the Altmer, Ayleids, and early Orcs, and was regarded as a god who stood for strength, honor, and unity. However, his legacy is deeply entwined with his transformation into Malacath, a Daedric Prince, after an encounter with Boethiah.  According to legend, Boethiah consumed Trinimac and took on his form to spread new teachings among the Aldmer, leading to the creation of the Chimer and Orcs. Boethiah''s act of devouring Trinimac resulted in his followers transforming into the Orsimer (Orcs), and Trinimac himself was reborn as Malacath, a weaker and vengeful version of his former self. While many Orcs continued to worship Malacath, others maintained belief in the purity of Trinimac. During the Second Era, leaders like King Kurog and King Gortwog revived the worship of Trinimac, positioning him as a god of unity and civilization, in contrast to the savage nature associated with Malacath. Trinimac’s story remains central to the identity and history of the Orcs and is a key figure in the cultural divergence between Chimer and Orsimer.', NULL);

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('talos', 'Talos, also known as Tiber Septim, was a legendary figure who rose to prominence as the first Emperor of the unified Tamriel and later ascended to godhood. In life, Talos conquered all of Tamriel, founding the Third Empire and ushering in the Third Era. Born in Atmora, his birth name, Talos, means "Stormcrown" in the ancient Ehlnofey language. Throughout his military and political career, he was also known by other titles, including Ysmir, Dragon of the North, the Grey Wind, and Storm of Kyne. His legendary conquests culminated in the subjugation of the Aldmeri Dominion, leading to his later veneration by humans as the "Hero-God of Mankind." Upon his death in 3E 38, Tiber Septim is believed to have ascended to become the ninth Divine, joining the pantheon of the Eight Divines as Talos.  Talos is revered as the patron of warriors, adventurers, and rulers, symbolizing the virtues of strength, courage, and leadership. His divine status, however, is a point of contention, especially among the Altmer, who view his apotheosis with hostility due to his conquest of their lands. In the Fourth Era, worship of Talos was banned following the White-Gold Concordat between the Aldmeri Dominion and the Empire, which claimed that a man could not achieve godhood. This ban ignited the Skyrim Civil War, with the Stormcloaks, led by Ulfric Stormcloak, rebelling in defense of their right to worship Talos. Despite the ban, Talos remains a powerful symbol of unity and strength for many, particularly among the Nords and other human races.

Often referred to as the Demon of Knowledge or Gardener of Men, Mora''s insatiable curiosity leads him to amass all information that exists or ever will exist. He is not concerned with altering fate but rather with ensuring that nothing remains unknown. Mora is known to entrap mortals with the lure of forbidden knowledge, offering immense power in exchange for their servitude. However, this knowledge often comes at a high cost, as mortals who delve too deeply into his secrets risk madness or the loss of their identity.  Mora resides in Apocrypha, his plane of Oblivion, an infinite library filled with untitled black books containing forbidden secrets. The realm is populated by his servants, including Seekers and Lurkers, grotesque creatures that enforce Mora''s will.

Though he is known for his sportsmanship and values fairness in the hunt, his followers and cults sometimes take his worship to brutal extremes.

This curse led to the recurring Greymarch, during which Jyggalag would briefly reclaim his form before reverting back to Sheogorath.  Sheogorath is revered and feared in many cultures, especially among the Khajiit, who call him the Skooma Cat, and the Dunmer, who regard him as one of the Four Corners of the House of Troubles.

The volcanic activity of Red Mountain, including lava flows and ash-falls, contributes to a constant cycle of ecological renewal, enriching the soil and allowing new plants and fungi to flourish in the aftermath of eruptions.  Historically, Vvardenfell was home to House Dagoth, the only Chimer clan with its capital located on the island, alongside a significant Dwemer kingdom. However, the influence of Dagoth Ur and the corruption of the Ash Blight dramatically impacted the island''s environment and its inhabitants, leading to a noticeable decline in its vibrancy by the late Third Era, including the extinction of native species such as Cliff Striders and Nix-Oxen. The island faced catastrophic destruction during the Red Year in 4E 5 when the Ministry of Truth collided with the city of Vivec, triggering a massive eruption of Red Mountain.

The aftermath of the battle was shrouded in mystery, as it culminated in the sudden disappearance of the entire Dwemer race from Nirn, a phenomenon that remains one of the great enigmas of Tamrielic history.

As a result, dragons held a position of supremacy over mankind, with dragon priests serving as their powerful intermediaries, enforcing laws and maintaining order in society. Temples were erected to honor these dragons, many of which remain as draugr-infested ruins today.

This shift in demeanor is believed to have been influenced by Alduin, the First-Born of Akatosh, who sought to dominate Mundus. The ensuing discontent led to the ancient Dragon War, in which humans, aided by some dragons, eventually triumphed over Alduin and his cult. The dragon priests were overthrown, and the dragons were driven into hiding. Despite their fall, the Dragon Cult adapted, preserving the practice of constructing dragon mounds for the remains of fallen dragons, as they awaited the day of their return.

Those who achieve CHIM are rumored to possess the ability to reshape the world, with some legends claiming that Tiber Septim used this power to transform Cyrodiil from an endless jungle into a temperate land.  The process of attaining CHIM is one of the six "Walking Ways" to divinity.

His expansion across the seas of Oblivion struck fear and envy into the hearts of other Daedric Princes, leading them to curse him into becoming Sheogorath, the Madgod—his antithesis. This curse created a paradox: Jyggalag, the embodiment of order, became the incarnation of chaos and madness. However, every era culminated in the Greymarch, a cycle where Jyggalag would briefly reclaim his form, only to be reverted back to Sheogorath after his conquest of the Shivering Isles.  The cycle of the Greymarch was ultimately broken during the events of the Third Era when the Hero of Kvatch, chosen by Sheogorath, confronted Jyggalag during his return. Armed with the Staff of Sheogorath and the mantle of the Madgod, the Hero defeated the Prince of Order, ending the Greymarch and separating Jyggalag from Sheogorath forever. Jyggalag acknowledged the Hero''s victory, departing the Shivering Isles to roam Oblivion once more, perhaps to exact vengeance on those who cursed him or to pursue grander, unknown ambitions. His legacy endures through his artifact, the Sword of Jyggalag, a crystalline claymore imbued with the power to reveal the flow of time.

His departure from Mundus tore a hole into Aetherius, forming the sun, which is also referred to as Magnus. The stars, believed to be fragments of his being or tears in the sky made by his followers, the Magna Ge, illuminate the night as remnants of his retreat. Magnus’s legacy is steeped in mysticism, as he is credited with creating powerful artifacts like the Staff of Magnus and the Eye of Magnus, each holding immense arcane power capable of influencing the balance of the magical world.  Worship of Magnus varies across Tamriel. The Altmer and Bretons revere him as the God of Sight and Insight, while the Khajiit call him Magrus, the Cat''s Eye, integrating his mythos into their lunar cycles. The Ayleids dedicated temples to his name, celebrating his association with light and divine order. Legends suggest Magnus influences powerful mages, lending them his energy, though his contributions to Mundus are viewed with skepticism by the Imperials, who question the dual nature of his gift.

This exile marked the beginning of Mannimarco''s ascent into infamy as he gathered followers and became the world''s first lich, earning the title "King of Worms." His mastery of necromancy allowed him to tap into forbidden arts, consorting with Daedra like Molag Bal and creating vile artifacts such as the Necromancer''s Amulet and the Staff of Worms. Mannimarco''s influence spread across Tamriel through his cult, the Worm Cult, which orchestrated political schemes and dark rituals, including the catastrophic Soulburst during the Planemeld.  Mannimarco''s pursuit of power culminated during the Warp in the West, a mysterious event in which he achieved apotheosis, transforming into a divine being embodied by the Necromancer''s Moon, also known as the Revenant. Despite this ascension, Mannimarco maintained a tangible presence in Tamriel, clashing with the Mages Guild and other enemies, such as the Hero of Kvatch, who destroyed his mortal form in 3E 433. His divine legacy, however, persisted, as the Necromancer''s Moon continued to empower his followers, allowing them to corrupt soul gems and perpetuate his dark influence.

The Hist are believed to predate all mortal races, surviving the catastrophic wars of the Ehlnofey. Their collective consciousness spans across Nirn, allowing them to act as one entity, though rogue Hist, like the one in Lilmoth, occasionally sever this bond. The Hist are pivotal to Argonian life, nurturing their eggs during hatching rituals and guiding their culture through mystical communion, dreams, and visions. Marsh-born Argonians wield Hist-specific magic and are deeply tied to their roots, whereas those hatched outside Black Marsh, known as lukiul, often struggle to hear the Hist''s voice.  Legends surrounding the Hist highlight their role in major historical events, such as the Oblivion Crisis, where they rallied Argonians to invade Mehrunes Dagon''s realms, leading to a decisive victory. The Hist are also known for their strange artifacts and manifestations, such as the Dreaming Tree, which preserved the souls of an Argonian tribe during an Ayleid invasion, and the Sleeping Tree in Skyrim, speculated to be a "cousin" of the Hist from Oblivion. Hist sap, a potent and mystical substance, is capable of altering living beings, enhancing combat abilities, and even creating dangerous bloodlust when consumed improperly.

This pivotal contribution marked the beginning of the Yokudans'' war with the Aldmer. As one of the most beloved deities in Hammerfell, Leki represents skill, adaptability, and divine ingenuity in the art of combat.  Her legend extends beyond the battlefield, influencing the cultural and spiritual fabric of Redguard society. The settlement of Leki''s Blade in the Alik''r Desert is said to have been founded following her duel with Rada al-Saran, a warrior who boasted mastery rivaling the gods. The goddess''s legacy also runs through the bloodlines of notable Redguard warriors, such as Sai Sahan, who descended from her line and embodied her divine connection to swordsmanship.

The Cult of the Ancestor Moth, a revered order of monks, maintains a deep relationship with the moths, using their ethereal songs in the Ritual of the Ancestor Moth to decipher the Elder Scrolls. The moths serve as conduits to ancient augury, amplifying their soft trilling into a primal form of divination that allows the priests to glean truths hidden within the scrolls. This sacred bond is maintained through rituals involving mantras and crushed canticle bark, the moths'' favored sustenance.  Beyond their spiritual role, the Ancestor Moth produces ancestor silk, a crimson-red material imbued with magical properties. The silk, harvested during a sacred ceremony, is used to create light armor and exotic textiles, some of which are believed to carry the memories of the deceased.

Known as the First Serpent, Satakal embodies the fusion of Anu and Padomay, symbolizing both chaos and order. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal devours entire worlds, shedding its skin to birth new ones, a process that has occurred countless times. This eternal cycle inspired the birth of spirits like Ruptga, the first to learn how to survive these transitions, who later formed the Yokudan pantheon. Satakal''s cycles echo the Redguard understanding of mortality and the longing for the Far Shores, the ultimate spiritual haven they believe lies beyond the reach of mortal life.  Worship of Satakal is prevalent among Redguard nomads of the Alik''r Desert, where the deity is revered as both destroyer and creator. Rituals dedicated to Satakal often involve symbolic "shedding of skin," and its devotees weave the serpent into their maps and lives as a reminder of the god''s dominion over all. Some groups, such as the Pyre Watch and Hunding’s sword-singers, interpret Satakal''s influence as a call to cast aside fixed destinies in pursuit of transcendence. Satakal’s worship is deeply rooted in Redguard culture, influencing not only their spiritual practices but also their myths, oaths, and settlements, such as the city of Satakalaam.

Using his immense height, he placed the stars in the sky to serve as a guiding map for other spirits seeking escape. However, Ruptga’s role is not only that of a savior; he also acted as a judge, punishing Sep, the Second Serpent, for deceiving spirits into inhabiting the mortal world, which left them vulnerable to hunger and mortality. The void left by Sep’s death remains as a hungry force chasing the stars, a haunting reminder of his trickery.  Worship of Ruptga is rich in symbolism, often featuring star motifs that reflect his role as the celestial guide. He is associated with the color purple, which adorns prayer beads dedicated to him. Myths also link Ruptga to his divine family, including his daughter Leki, the goddess of swordsmanship, and his estranged son Zeht, the god of agriculture, who renounced him after the world’s creation. Ruptga''s legacy is woven into Redguard culture, with his influence reflected in their oaths, exclamations, and spiritual practices.

HoonDing’s influence persisted through other figures, including Frandar Hunding, who led the Yokudans in their exodus to Tamriel and their battles against Malooc the Horde King. During the Tiber War, HoonDing''s essence was linked to Crown Prince A''tor and the legendary warrior Cyrus. A''tor''s transformation into the Soul Sword and Cyrus’s wielding of it to slay the dragon Nafaalilargus exemplify HoonDing''s duality as both a weapon and a symbol of leadership.

These writs allowed assassins to carry out legal executions with complete immunity, cementing their role in Dunmeri politics. Despite their lawful standing in Morrowind, their methods and allegiance to Mephala stirred controversy. Some legends suggest the guild originally worshipped Sithis and even influenced the formation of the Dark Brotherhood, a splinter group that rose to prominence outside of Morrowind. Over centuries, the Morag Tong oscillated between shadowy obscurity and political power, adapting to the changing tides of history.  The guild''s practices reflect Mephala''s principles of subtlety and precision, with their assassins employing shortblades, light armor, and archery as their tools of choice. Their deadly arsenal is meticulously crafted, blending functionality with intimidating designs that evoke chitinous creatures. The Morag Tong''s influence waned during periods of upheaval, such as after the assassination of the Akaviri Potentate Versidue-Shaie, but they resurfaced in times of need, maintaining their ancient role as arbiters of Dunmeri vendettas.

Historically linked to the Druids of Galen, the Glenmoril Wyrd broke away due to differing philosophies, choosing to live as reclusive protectors of the wilds. They see themselves as part of nature itself, drawing their power from the land and maintaining a delicate balance between life and death.  The covens are spread across regions such as High Rock, Skyrim, and Bangkorai, each with distinct beliefs and practices. While many covens venerate Hircine, others align with Daedric Princes like Namira or Molag Bal, creating both alliances and rivalries with groups like the Reachmen. The Glenmoril Wyrd has been influential in major events throughout history, such as assisting in the Bloodmoon Prophecy on Solstheim and making a pact with the Companions of Whiterun that introduced lycanthropy into their ranks. Over time, some covens have dwindled, such as the hagraven-led Glenmoril witches in Falkreath Hold, who became the last of their kind in Skyrim by the Fourth Era.

Members of the Tong take pride in their dark history, promoting a vision of Morrowind where outsiders are either enslaved or expelled. Despite their xenophobic ideology, the Tong occasionally collaborates with foreigners when profit outweighs prejudice. Throughout its history, the Camonna Tong has clashed with abolitionist groups, Great Houses, and rival factions like the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild while maintaining its power in Morrowind’s criminal underworld.  By the Third Era, the Camonna Tong wielded significant influence through its alliance with House Hlaalu, operating openly in towns like Balmora, Hla Oad, and Vivec City. Under Orvas Dren, the Tong became intertwined with House Hlaalu''s leadership, controlling councilors and influencing major decisions while secretly allying with the Sixth House during the Nerevarine prophecy. The Tong’s collaboration with corrupt Fighters Guild leaders further extended its reach, using the guild to eliminate competitors like the Imperial Thieves Guild. However, its dominance waned as the Nerevarine dismantled its power base, and its future after the Oblivion Crisis, Red Year, and Argonian Invasion remains uncertain.

The Company’s rise to power was tied to their use of Hist sap, extracted from a sick Hist tree smuggled out of Black Marsh. This sap granted their members increased combat prowess but caused dangerous hallucinogenic bloodlust in non-Argonians. The Hero of Kvatch, infiltrating the Company on behalf of the Fighters Guild, uncovered this secret after being drugged and manipulated into slaughtering innocent townsfolk at Water’s Edge, believing them to be goblins. The Hero later destroyed the Hist tree and its extraction mechanism, killing the remaining Blackwood Company members in the process. With the Blackwood Company dismantled, the Fighters Guild was saved from collapse, and the Hero of Kvatch was named Guildmaster, marking the end of the Blackwood Company’s chaotic legacy.', NULL);

Once the grand city of Bromjunaar, it served as the capital of the Dragon Cult during the Merethic Era, housing its most powerful Dragon Priests. Over time, with the defeat of the Dragon Cult in the Dragon War, Bromjunaar fell into ruin, leaving behind remnants of its dark and powerful past. Among its most enigmatic features is the sanctuary of masks, where the legendary mask Konahrik could only be accessed by gathering the eight lesser Dragon Priest masks scattered across Skyrim. The ruins were later modified in the First Era by the Archmage Shalidor, who constructed a treacherous labyrinth to test aspiring archmages, further cementing the site’s reputation as a place of trials and secrets.', NULL);

Their unique appearance, ranging from pearlescent white to blue skin, with fin-like ears and occasionally gills, reflects their adaptation to a life at sea. Under the rule of their immortal leader King Orgnum, a deathless sorcerer said to grow younger with age, the Maormer have relentlessly sought to conquer the Summerset Isles, driven by their hatred for the Altmer. Their mastery of snake magic allows them to tame sea serpents as mounts and war beasts, and their storm mages wield the elements of water, wind, and lightning to devastating effect in naval warfare.  Despite their isolation, the Maormer have clashed with Tamrielic nations throughout history, most notably in the War of the Isle in 3E 110, where their armada was defeated by the combined forces of the Psijic Order, Summerset''s navy, and the Empire. Known for their clan-based society and a culture deeply tied to the sea, the Maormer are infamous for their acrobatic sailors, serpent-like warbeasts, and vicious storm rituals.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('falmer', 'The Falmer, also called Snow Ghosts or Betrayed, are blind, degenerated descendants of the ancient Snow Elves who now dwell in Skyrim''s dark depths. Once a proud and prosperous race of Mer, the Snow Elves were driven underground after centuries of war with the invading Nords. Seeking refuge with the Dwemer, they were forced into servitude, fed toxic fungi that blinded them, and subjected to generations of cruelty that twisted them into the creatures now feared as Falmer. Pale, hunched, and goblin-like, they have become a symbol of tragic corruption, stalking intruders in the underground labyrinths of Dwemer ruins and beyond. Nordic folklore even attributes their disfigurement to Ysgramor cutting their noses off to distinguish them from other Elves.  Despite their degeneration, Falmer have adapted to subterranean life with remarkable resilience. They cultivate fungi, fish the underground waterways, and breed the fearsome Chaurus, whose chitin they use to craft weapons, armor, and even dwellings. Their society is tribal and brutal, relying on raiding surface dwellers for slaves and resources, and they harbor an enduring hatred for all but their own. While they are often dismissed as monsters, some—including Knight-Paladin Gelebor, the last known uncorrupted Snow Elf—view them as tragic figures. Gelebor holds hope that they may one day reclaim their former identity, though the Falmer''s increasing aggression suggests their future may be one of conquest rather than redemption.', NULL);
INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('black_books', 'Black Books are Daedric artifacts created by Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince of Fate and Knowledge. These ancient tomes, bound in black covers and emitting an eerie mist, contain forbidden secrets from the past, present, or future. Each book serves as a gateway to Apocrypha, Mora''s realm in Oblivion, and holds dangerous yet tantalizing knowledge for those the Prince favors. Crafted with extraordinary materials, such as Seeker ink and Lurker leather, the books are perilous to read, often driving mortals insane. However, those who can navigate Apocrypha’s trials are rewarded with powerful insights or abilities. The true number of Black Books is known only to Hermaeus Mora, and they are often found hidden in ancient, treacherous dungeons across Tamriel.  In 4E 201, several Black Books were discovered on Solstheim, drawing mortals into Mora''s realm to test their resolve. When read, tentacles from the book envelop the reader, transporting their consciousness to Apocrypha while leaving a tethered apparition behind in Mundus. Within the realm, readers must face Mora’s gauntlets to claim the book’s secrets. While death in Apocrypha typically results in banishment back to Tamriel, the knowledge gained can be revisited by rereading the book. Revered for their otherworldly power, Black Books stand as a testament to the vast, unfathomable reach of Hermaeus Mora''s influence over time, space, and mortal curiosity.', NULL);

This golden crown features a striking winged motif adorned with twenty-four ornate jewels, known as the Stones of Barenziah, set across its wings and a central gem on its temple. However, the crown’s grandeur was short-lived as it was stolen shortly after the coronation. The thief pried the stones from the crown, scattering them across Skyrim. The crown itself remained in Morrowind for much of its history, while the Thieves Guild of Skyrim sought to recover its scattered stones for centuries. In 4E 5, amidst the Red Year and the chaos of Vvardenfell''s eruption, the crown was transported to Skyrim by fleeing refugees, only to be lost in Tolvald''s Cave, where its guardians perished.', NULL);

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('dragon_wars', 'The Dragon War was a pivotal conflict in the Merethic Era, marking a violent upheaval between dragons and the human population of Skyrim. When Ysgramor and his people arrived in Tamriel, they brought with them a faith that worshipped animals, including the dragon, which held a central role as a god-king figure. Grand temples were constructed to honor the dragons, and dragon priests were granted power in exchange for ruling humanity on their behalf. However, this balance of power shifted as the dragon priests grew tyrannical, enslaving the population and demanding absolute obedience. When rebellion broke out, the dragons retaliated with devastating force, sparking the Dragon War.  Initially, humanity suffered immense losses, but the tide shifted when certain dragons sided with men. It is said that from these traitorous dragons, men learned powerful magics, possibly with the intervention of Akatosh, allowing them to combat their former overlords. Over time, the dragon priests were overthrown, and dragons were hunted to near extinction. The remnants of the dragon cult preserved their belief in the dragons'' eventual return, entombing fallen dragons in dragon mounds and maintaining their faith. The war not only shaped Skyrim''s ancient history but left a legacy evident in its ruins, myths, and the fearsome reputation of dragons.', NULL);
INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('alessian_slave_rebellion', 'The Alessian Slave Rebellion was a landmark conflict in Tamrielic history, spanning from 1E 242 to 1E 243. Led by the Slave-Queen Alessia, the rebellion marked the liberation of the Nedic people from their Ayleid overlords, who had dominated Cyrodiil through a brutal regime of Daedra worship, enslavement, and ritual cruelty. With divine guidance from the Eight Divines and the aid of key allies like Pelinal Whitestrake and Morihaus, Alessia united human slaves and sympathetic Ayleid factions in a desperate uprising. The rebellion culminated in the Siege of White-Gold Tower, where Pelinal slew the demigod Umaril the Unfeathered but fell in battle. This victory dismantled the Ayleid Empire and laid the foundation for the Alessian Empire, ushering in the dominance of men over mer in Cyrodiil.  The rebellion not only freed the Nedic slaves but also began the Ayleids'' gradual decline. Many Daedra-worshipping Ayleids fled to Valenwood and High Rock, while their remaining city-states either integrated into the new Empire as vassals or were annihilated by the Alessian forces. The rebellion’s aftermath saw Alessia crowned as the first Empress of Cyrodiil, the establishment of the Amulet of Kings to protect Mundus from Oblivion, and the rise of the Imperial Pantheon, blending elements of Nordic and Elven faiths. However, centuries later, the rise of the Alessian Order would erase much of the Ayleid presence from Cyrodiil, ensuring the once-mighty Heartland High Elves faded into obscurity. The rebellion marked a critical turning point in Tamriel’s history, redefining its religious, cultural, and political landscape.', NULL);

Its rich history traces back to the First Era when it was a pivotal player in the Colovian resistance against the Alessian Order. Over the eras, Kvatch endured turbulent events, including civil skirmishes, the ravages of the Camoran Usurper in the Third Era, and the catastrophic sacking by Daedra during the Oblivion Crisis in 3E 433. Despite these trials, the city''s resilient spirit and strategic importance have ensured its continued prominence.  During the Oblivion Crisis, Kvatch was nearly annihilated when Mehrunes Dagon''s forces opened an Oblivion Gate and reduced the city to ruins. Survivors, including Martin Septim, sought refuge outside the city, while the Hero of Kvatch led a valiant effort to close the gate and retake Kvatch Castle. The Fourth Era saw Kvatch slowly rebuild, regaining its stature by the time of the Great War in 4E 171. ', NULL);
