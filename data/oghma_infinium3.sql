During the Dawn Era, he collaborated with other et''Ada to forge the mortal plane, but upon realizing the great sacrifice required, he abandoned the project. His departure from Mundus tore a hole into Aetherius, forming the sun, which is also referred to as Magnus. The stars, believed to be fragments of his being or tears in the sky made by his followers, the Magna Ge, illuminate the night as remnants of his retreat. Magnus’s legacy is steeped in mysticism, as he is credited with creating powerful artifacts like the Staff of Magnus and the Eye of Magnus, each holding immense arcane power capable of influencing the balance of the magical world.  Worship of Magnus varies across Tamriel. The Altmer and Bretons revere him as the God of Sight and Insight, while the Khajiit call him Magrus, the Cat''s Eye, integrating his mythos into their lunar cycles. The Ayleids dedicated temples to his name, celebrating his association with light and divine order. Legends suggest Magnus influences powerful mages, lending them his energy, though his contributions to Mundus are viewed with skepticism by the Imperials, who question the dual nature of his gift. Despite his detachment from Nirn, Magnus remains a symbol of the enigmatic power of magic, with his artifacts and celestial presence serving as constant reminders of the god who shaped the mystical fabric of the world.', '''abandon'':52B ''across'':146B ''ada'':38B ''aetherius'':63B ''also'':69B ''altmer'':149B ''among'':15B ''and'':7B,123B,150B,159B,190B,241B ''arcan'':131B ''architect'':10B ''are'':208B ''artifacts'':117B,240B ''as'':21B,72B,98B,110B,154B,245B ''association'':187B ''ayleids'':179B ''balanc'':137B ''be'':78B ''being'':82B ''believ'':76B ''bretons'':151B ''but'':44B ''by'':89B,212B ''call'':164B ''capabl'':133B ''cat'':168B ''celebrating'':185B ''celestial'':242B ''collaborat'':34B ''constant'':246B ''contributions'':205B ''creating'':115B ''creator'':23B ''credit'':113B ''cultur'':17B ''cycles'':177B ''dawn'':31B ''dedicat'':180B ''departur'':56B ''despit'':223B ''detachment'':225B ''divin'':191B ''dual'':218B ''during'':29B ''each'':128B ''energy'':202B ''enigmatic'':234B ''et'':37B ''eye'':125B,170B ''fabric'':255B ''figur'':14B ''followers'':91B ''for'':27B ''forg'':40B ''forming'':64B ''fragments'':79B ''from'':57B,226B ''ge'':94B ''gift'':222B ''god'':4B,156B,250B ''great'':9B,48B ''him'':153B,165B ''his'':55B,81B,90B,101B,172B,183B,186B,201B,204B,221B,224B,239B ''hol'':61B ''holding'':129B ''illuminat'':95B ''immens'':130B ''imperials'':214B ''in'':18B,85B,108B ''influenc'':196B ''influencing'':135B ''insight'':160B ''integrating'':171B ''into'':62B,174B ''is'':11B,68B,106B,112B ''khajiit'':163B ''known'':20B ''legacy'':105B ''legends'':193B ''lending'':199B ''light'':189B ''lik'':118B ''lun'':176B ''mad'':88B ''mag'':198B ''magic'':6B,237B ''magical'':140B ''magn'':93B ''magnus'':1A,2B,73B,103B,122B,127B,144B,195B,228B ''magrus'':166B ''many'':16B ''mortal'':42B ''mundus'':28B,58B,207B ''mystical'':254B ''mysticism'':109B ''mythos'':173B ''nam'':184B ''natur'':219B ''night'':97B ''nirn'':227B ''of'':5B,24B,80B,100B,121B,126B,134B,138B,143B,157B,220B,232B,236B,248B,256B ''or'':83B ''order'':192B ''other'':36B ''plan'':43B ''pow'':132B,235B ''powerful'':116B,197B ''presenc'':243B ''project'':54B ''question'':216B ''realizing'':46B ''referr'':70B ''remains'':229B ''reminders'':247B ''remnants'':99B ''requir'':50B ''retreat'':102B ''rever'':13B,152B ''s'':104B,169B ''sacrific'':49B ''schematics'':26B ''serving'':244B ''shap'':252B ''sight'':158B ''skepticism'':211B ''sky'':87B ''staff'':120B ''stars'':75B ''steep'':107B ''suggest'':194B ''sun'':66B ''symbol'':231B ''tamriel'':19B,147B ''tears'':84B ''templ'':181B ''the'':3B,8B,22B,25B,30B,41B,47B,53B,65B,74B,86B,92B,96B,119B,124B,136B,139B,148B,155B,162B,167B,175B,178B,213B,217B,233B,249B,253B,257B ''them'':200B ''though'':203B ''to'':39B,71B,77B,182B,206B ''tor'':59B ''upon'':45B ''vari'':145B ''view'':209B ''which'':67B ''whil'':161B ''who'':215B,251B ''with'':35B,114B,188B,210B,238B ''world'':141B,258B ''worship'':142B');

The Skaal believe that Solstheim was once part of Skyrim and became an island following a great conflict between Dragon Cult loyalists, from whom they claim descent, and rebels. Their isolation allowed them to form a unique culture over time, one rooted in oral traditions and a deep spiritual bond with the natural world.

The most significant of these occurred during the Sun''s Death in 1E 668, the Days of Fire in 2E 882, and the Red Year in 4E 5, the latter causing widespread devastation and a mass exodus of the local population.

In later centuries, the volcano became associated with Dagoth Ur, a being who emerged from within it and challenged the Tribunal''s power. To contain the Ash Blight emanating from the mountain, the Tribunal constructed the Ghostfence, restricting access to the area. Following the defeat of Dagoth Ur by the Nerevarine in 3E 427, the stability of the mountain was further compromised, leading to the catastrophic Red Year eruption in 4E 5.

In the First Era, Dagoth Ur played a pivotal role in the events leading up to the Battle of Red Mountain. His revelation to the Hortator Indoril Nerevar about House Dagoth''s discovery of the Heart of Lorkhan, a powerful source of divine energy, marked him as a traitor in the eyes of the Chimer. Following the battle, which resulted in the defeat of Dagoth and the Sixth House, he and his followers were largely erased from history by the Tribunal Temple. However, Dagoth Ur and his kin survived, lying dormant beneath Red Mountain for millennia. He eventually awoke in the late Second Era, devising plans to construct a new Numidium named Akulakhan and unleashing the Blight across Morrowind, creating horrific Corprus monsters and threatening the Tribunal''s power. His reign of terror concluded in the late Third Era when the Nerevarine ventured into Red Mountain and ultimately defeated him, bringing an end to his dark influence over the region.', '''about'':116B ''across'':205B ''akulakh'':200B ''an'':239B ''and'':17B,32B,49B,75B,153B,158B,173B,201B,211B,234B ''as'':7B,23B,40B,65B,72B,84B,134B ''awaken'':43B ''awok'':186B ''battl'':105B,145B ''beneath'':179B ''blight'':204B ''bringing'':238B ''by'':37B,54B,166B ''central'':12B ''chim'':142B ''conclud'':221B ''construct'':195B ''corprus'':209B ''councilor'':28B ''creating'':207B ''dagoth'':1A,3B,9B,31B,92B,118B,152B,171B ''dark'':243B ''defeat'':150B,236B ''demoniz'':64B ''devil'':74B ''devising'':192B ''discovery'':120B ''divin'':130B ''dormant'':178B ''dream'':87B ''embodiment'':67B ''end'':240B ''enemy'':77B ''energy'':131B ''eras'':163B ''events'':100B ''eventually'':185B ''evil'':69B ''eyes'':139B ''fals'':86B ''fath'':50B ''figur'':13B ''first'':90B ''followers'':56B,160B ''following'':143B ''for'':182B ''from'':164B ''heart'':123B ''high'':27B ''him'':83B,133B,237B ''his'':55B,109B,159B,174B,217B,242B ''history'':16B,165B ''horrific'':208B ''hortator'':113B ''hous'':30B,48B,117B,156B ''howev'':170B ''immortal'':25B ''in'':14B,57B,88B,98B,137B,148B,187B,222B ''indoril'':114B ''influenc'':244B ''into'':231B ''is'':10B,33B,63B ''kin'':175B ''known'':6B ''label'':71B ''largely'':162B ''lat'':189B,224B ''leading'':78B,101B ''lord'':26B,44B ''lorkh'':125B ''lying'':177B ''mark'':132B ''millenni'':183B ''monsters'':210B ''morrowind'':20B,206B ''mountain'':53B,108B,181B,233B ''mythology'':18B ''nam'':199B ''narrativ'':61B ''nerev'':115B ''nerevarin'':229B ''new'':197B ''numidium'':198B ''of'':19B,29B,45B,51B,68B,82B,106B,121B,124B,129B,140B,151B,219B ''often'':34B,70B ''originally'':5B ''over'':245B ''perception'':81B ''pivotal'':96B ''plans'':193B ''play'':94B ''pow'':216B ''powerful'':127B ''red'':107B,180B,232B ''referr'':35B ''region'':247B ''reign'':218B ''result'':147B ''revelation'':110B ''rol'':97B ''s'':60B,119B,215B ''second'':190B ''serv'':22B ''sharmat'':42B ''sixth'':47B,155B ''sourc'':128B ''such'':39B ''surviv'':176B ''templ'':169B ''terror'':220B ''the'':15B,24B,41B,46B,52B,58B,66B,73B,76B,85B,89B,99B,104B,112B,122B,138B,141B,144B,149B,154B,167B,188B,203B,213B,223B,228B,246B ''third'':225B ''threatening'':212B ''titl'':38B ''to'':36B,79B,103B,111B,194B,241B ''traitor'':136B ''tribunal'':59B,168B,214B ''ultimately'':235B ''unleashing'':202B ''up'':102B ''ur'':2A,4B,93B,172B ''ventur'':230B ''voryn'':8B ''wer'':161B ''when'':227B ''which'':146B');

The landscape of Vvardenfell is characterized by arid wastelands, rocky highlands, and coastal wetlands that host a variety of unique flora and fauna. The volcanic activity of Red Mountain, including lava flows and ash-falls, contributes to a constant cycle of ecological renewal, enriching the soil and allowing new plants and fungi to flourish in the aftermath of eruptions.  Historically, Vvardenfell was home to House Dagoth, the only Chimer clan with its capital located on the island, alongside a significant Dwemer kingdom. However, the influence of Dagoth Ur and the corruption of the Ash Blight dramatically impacted the island''s environment and its inhabitants, leading to a noticeable decline in its vibrancy by the late Third Era, including the extinction of native species such as Cliff Striders and Nix-Oxen. The island faced catastrophic destruction during the Red Year in 4E 5 when the Ministry of Truth collided with the city of Vivec, triggering a massive eruption of Red Mountain.

Their religion, known as the Old Ways, venerates a pantheon of gods, including Kyne, the goddess of the sky, and Shor, the god of the underworld. Nords also revere the Thu’um, the power of the Voice, a mystical force used by legendary warriors known as Tongues. Nords have a distinct architectural style, marked by wooden longhouses and fortresses, and their funerary customs emphasize ancestor worship, with burial sites treated as sacred places. Their cultural heritage and warrior spirit define much of their identity, making them one of Tamriel’s most formidable and respected peoples.', '''across'':54B ''adventurers'':53B ''all'':43B ''also'':3B,150B ''ancestor'':121B,187B ''and'':31B,37B,61B,70B,107B,120B,142B,180B,182B,199B,215B ''architectural'':174B ''are'':11B,101B ''around'':113B ''as'':5B,35B,49B,126B,168B,193B ''atmor'':82B ''back'':73B ''built'':112B ''burial'':190B ''by'':164B,177B ''childr'':7B ''cold'':30B ''combat'':46B ''conquests'':69B ''cultur'':57B ''cultural'':197B ''customs'':185B ''dating'':72B ''deeply'':59B ''defin'':202B ''distinct'':173B ''emphasiz'':186B ''establish'':94B ''excel'':41B ''fair'':17B ''fair-hair'':16B ''fam'':85B ''fierc'':36B ''fiercely'':102B ''fill'':65B ''for'':26B,86B ''forc'':162B ''formid'':214B ''forms'':44B ''fortress'':181B ''from'':20B,77B ''frost'':33B ''funerary'':184B ''god'':145B ''goddess'':138B ''gods'':134B ''hair'':18B ''hav'':92B,171B ''heritag'':198B ''history'':63B ''homeland'':96B ''honor'':118B ''humans'':19B ''identity'':206B ''in'':42B ''including'':135B ''independenc'':108B ''is'':58B,64B,111B ''known'':4B,34B,125B,167B ''kyne'':136B ''land'':80B ''legendary'':165B ''longhous'':179B ''loyalty'':119B ''magical'':32B ''making'':207B ''mark'':176B ''martial'':60B ''mercenari'':51B ''migration'':76B ''most'':213B ''much'':203B ''mystical'':161B ''nord'':1A ''nordic'':109B ''nords'':2B,40B,91B,149B,170B ''northern'':79B ''of'':8B,14B,23B,45B,68B,81B,97B,104B,117B,133B,139B,146B,157B,204B,210B ''often'':47B ''old'':128B ''once'':84B ''one'':209B ''or'':52B ''pantheon'':132B ''peopl'':217B ''plac'':195B ''pow'':156B ''powerful'':38B ''protectiv'':103B ''provinc'':22B ''prowess'':89B ''rac'':13B ''religion'':124B ''renown'':25B ''resistanc'':28B ''respect'':216B ''rever'':151B ''s'':212B ''sacr'':194B ''seafaring'':88B ''sens'':116B ''serving'':48B ''shor'':143B ''sinc'':93B ''sit'':191B ''sky'':10B,141B ''skyrim'':24B,98B ''society'':110B ''soldiers'':50B ''spirit'':201B ''strong'':115B ''style'':175B ''tal'':67B ''tall'':15B ''tamriel'':55B,211B ''the'':6B,9B,21B,27B,56B,62B,75B,78B,87B,90B,95B,105B,123B,127B,137B,140B,144B,147B,152B,155B,158B,183B,196B,205B ''them'':208B ''they'':100B ''though'':83B ''thu'':153B ''to'':29B,74B ''tong'':169B ''traditions'':106B ''treat'':192B ''um'':154B ''underworld'':148B ''used'':163B ''venerat'':130B ''voic'':159B ''warfar'':71B ''warrior'':200B ''warriors'':39B,166B ''ways'':129B ''wher'':99B ''with'':66B,189B ''wood'':178B ''worship'':122B,188B');

Worship of Julianos is prevalent in the Imperial City, where a Chantry is dedicated to him, as well as in the Iliac Bay region, where his temples are called Schools of Julianos, functioning as centers of education. The ancient Nords once worshipped him as Jhunal, the father of language and mathematics, before he became part of the Divines under the name Julianos.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('jyggalag', 'Jyggalag, the Prince of Order, is a Daedric Prince whose sphere encompasses logical order, deduction, and the unyielding structure of the cosmos. Known as the "Gray Prince of Order," Jyggalag once ruled a realm of perfect symmetry and foresight, boasting a Great Library that held predictions of every event in Mundus and Oblivion. His expansion across the seas of Oblivion struck fear and envy into the hearts of other Daedric Princes, leading them to curse him into becoming Sheogorath, the Madgod—his antithesis. This curse created a paradox: Jyggalag, the embodiment of order, became the incarnation of chaos and madness. However, every era culminated in the Greymarch, a cycle where Jyggalag would briefly reclaim his form, only to be reverted back to Sheogorath after his conquest of the Shivering Isles.  The cycle of the Greymarch was ultimately broken during the events of the Third Era when the Hero of Kvatch, chosen by Sheogorath, confronted Jyggalag during his return. Armed with the Staff of Sheogorath and the mantle of the Madgod, the Hero defeated the Prince of Order, ending the Greymarch and separating Jyggalag from Sheogorath forever.

Founded in the First Era, the Morag Tong gained prominence as a means to settle disputes within Morrowind''s Great Houses, preventing open warfare through sanctioned killings known as Honorable Writs of Execution. These writs allowed assassins to carry out legal executions with complete immunity, cementing their role in Dunmeri politics. Despite their lawful standing in Morrowind, their methods and allegiance to Mephala stirred controversy. Some legends suggest the guild originally worshipped Sithis and even influenced the formation of the Dark Brotherhood, a splinter group that rose to prominence outside of Morrowind. Over centuries, the Morag Tong oscillated between shadowy obscurity and political power, adapting to the changing tides of history.  The guild''s practices reflect Mephala''s principles of subtlety and precision, with their assassins employing shortblades, light armor, and archery as their tools of choice. Their deadly arsenal is meticulously crafted, blending functionality with intimidating designs that evoke chitinous creatures.

Despite these trials, the city''s resilient spirit and strategic importance have ensured its continued prominence.  During the Oblivion Crisis, Kvatch was nearly annihilated when Mehrunes Dagon''s forces opened an Oblivion Gate and reduced the city to ruins. Survivors, including Martin Septim, sought refuge outside the city, while the Hero of Kvatch led a valiant effort to close the gate and retake Kvatch Castle.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('camora_tong', 'The Camonna Tong is a notorious Dunmer criminal syndicate rooted in Morrowind, infamous for its opposition to foreign influence and its ruthless criminal activities. As one of Tamriel''s oldest criminal organizations, the Tong has operated since at least the Second Era, engaging in smuggling, extortion, slavery, and murder, often targeting outlanders to protect what they see as Dunmeri sovereignty. Members of the Tong take pride in their dark history, promoting a vision of Morrowind where outsiders are either enslaved or expelled. Despite their xenophobic ideology, the Tong occasionally collaborates with foreigners when profit outweighs prejudice. Throughout its history, the Camonna Tong has clashed with abolitionist groups, Great Houses, and rival factions like the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild while maintaining its power in Morrowind’s criminal underworld.  By the Third Era, the Camonna Tong wielded significant influence through its alliance with House Hlaalu, operating openly in towns like Balmora, Hla Oad, and Vivec City. Under Orvas Dren, the Tong became intertwined with House Hlaalu''s leadership, controlling councilors and influencing major decisions while secretly allying with the Sixth House during the Nerevarine prophecy. The Tong’s collaboration with corrupt Fighters Guild leaders further extended its reach, using the guild to eliminate competitors like the Imperial Thieves Guild. However, its dominance waned as the Nerevarine dismantled its power base, and its future after the Oblivion Crisis, Red Year, and Argonian Invasion remains uncertain.

Comprised mainly of Argonians and Khajiit, the Company originated from soldiers who had failed to reclaim Black Marsh for the Empire. They set up operations in Leyawiin and the surrounding Blackwood Forest, naming themselves after the region and Khajiiti lore of "black charcoal warriors." Unlike the Fighters Guild, the Blackwood Company had no ethical constraints, taking on morally dubious contracts and accepting recruits without regard for criminal records or reputation. Their willingness to undercut competitors and employ reckless methods led to significant tensions with the Fighters Guild, culminating in a dangerous rivalry that nearly dismantled the Guild.  The Company’s rise to power was tied to their use of Hist sap, extracted from a sick Hist tree smuggled out of Black Marsh. This sap granted their members increased combat prowess but caused dangerous hallucinogenic bloodlust in non-Argonians. The Hero of Kvatch, infiltrating the Company on behalf of the Fighters Guild, uncovered this secret after being drugged and manipulated into slaughtering innocent townsfolk at Water’s Edge, believing them to be goblins. The Hero later destroyed the Hist tree and its extraction mechanism, killing the remaining Blackwood Company members in the process.

She is often invoked at weddings, where her priests bless unions and sanctify the vows between partners. Mara is also considered the patron of motherhood and is seen as a figure of mercy and benevolence, guiding mortals toward peaceful and harmonious lives. Her teachings emphasize the importance of love, both in relationships and within the broader community, promoting unity and tolerance.  Mara is revered by nearly all races in Tamriel, except for the Dunmer and Argonians, though even in those regions, she is recognized by smaller groups. Her presence in the pantheons varies, with the Nords viewing her as the concubine of Shor, while the Bretons and Altmer see her as the wife of Akatosh or Auriel. Mara is closely linked to fertility deities in other cultures, such as the Redguard goddess Morwha. Her worship often focuses on the nurturing aspects of life, and her temples and shrines, such as the one in Riften, are centers for marriage ceremonies and blessings.

Another tale suggests that Hircine sewed the armor from the hide of a werewolf. A lesser-known tradition credits Malacath, though this version mistakenly claims the Hide made its wearer vulnerable to magic.

This eternal cycle inspired the birth of spirits like Ruptga, the first to learn how to survive these transitions, who later formed the Yokudan pantheon. Satakal''s cycles echo the Redguard understanding of mortality and the longing for the Far Shores, the ultimate spiritual haven they believe lies beyond the reach of mortal life.  Worship of Satakal is prevalent among Redguard nomads of the Alik''r Desert, where the deity is revered as both destroyer and creator. Rituals dedicated to Satakal often involve symbolic "shedding of skin," and its devotees weave the serpent into their maps and lives as a reminder of the god''s dominion over all. Some groups, such as the Pyre Watch and Hunding’s sword-singers, interpret Satakal''s influence as a call to cast aside fixed destinies in pursuit of transcendence. Satakal’s worship is deeply rooted in Redguard culture, influencing not only their spiritual practices but also their myths, oaths, and settlements, such as the city of Satakalaam.

Originally known as the Temple of the Ancestors, the tower housed the Ten Ancestors, a collection of statues made from meteoric iron and glass. Established as an independent city-state around 1E 0, the tower remained a significant political and cultural center until the Alessian Slave Rebellion culminated in its capture in 1E 243.  Following its conquest by human forces led by Morihaus, the White-Gold Tower became a symbol of the emerging human-dominated Empires, eventually serving as the Imperial Palace. Some legends suggest that the tower''s presence altered the surrounding landscape of Cyrodiil, transforming it from a subtropical jungle into temperate forests and fields.

The remnants of the city are precariously perched above steep cliffs, with only a few intact structures remaining, including the Jarl''s Longhouse and the local inn. The College of Winterhold is isolated from the rest of the settlement by a deep ravine, connected only by a narrow stone bridge. Despite its diminished status, Winterhold continues to be a site of magical study and intrigue, with its harsh environment and rich history attracting scholars and adventurers alike.

Using his immense height, he placed the stars in the sky to serve as a guiding map for other spirits seeking escape. However, Ruptga’s role is not only that of a savior; he also acted as a judge, punishing Sep, the Second Serpent, for deceiving spirits into inhabiting the mortal world, which left them vulnerable to hunger and mortality. The void left by Sep’s death remains as a hungry force chasing the stars, a haunting reminder of his trickery.  Worship of Ruptga is rich in symbolism, often featuring star motifs that reflect his role as the celestial guide. He is associated with the color purple, which adorns prayer beads dedicated to him. Myths also link Ruptga to his divine family, including his daughter Leki, the goddess of swordsmanship, and his estranged son Zeht, the god of agriculture, who renounced him after the world’s creation. Ruptga''s legacy is woven into Redguard culture, with his influence reflected in their oaths, exclamations, and spiritual practices.

Revered and reviled, Lorkhan''s influence is woven into every culture’s mythology, and he is credited with initiating the creation of the mortal plane, Nirn. He convinced the et''Ada, the Original Spirits, to create Mundus, the world, disrupting the cosmic order. Following the world''s creation, Lorkhan was separated from his divine essence—most commonly through the removal of his Heart—and exiled from the divine realm. This event, referred to as the "shattering of Lorkhan," is depicted as a punishment for his role in the creation of the flawed mortal realm, though some legends suggest he willingly accepted this fate.  The perceptions of Lorkhan vary greatly between different races. To the Elves, he is a deceiver responsible for trapping them in the mortal realm, severing their connection to the spiritual plane. The Altmer view him as the ultimate antagonist, a being who imprisoned them in a world of suffering and limitation. Conversely, humans, especially Nords and Imperials, honor him as a heroic figure. In Skyrim, he is worshipped as Shor, the god who sacrificed himself to create the world. Redguards know him as Sep, a trickster who helped shape the mortal world but was cursed for his transgressions. Reachmen revere him as the Spirit of Man, while Khajiit associate him with Lorkhaj, the Moon Beast, whose heart''s corruption birthed the dark dro-m’Athra.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('Glenmoril_witches', 'The Glenmoril Wyrd, also known as the Glenmoril Coven or Glenmoril Witches, is a loose network of female-dominated Bretonic covens scattered across Tamriel. Revering nature and often associating with Daedric Princes like Hircine, the Wyrd enforces laws of nature known only to them, frequently leaning into its darker aspects. Their members, while primarily human, sometimes include beastfolk like hagravens and lamias, who often hold leadership roles. These covens are known for their unique practices, such as curing lycanthropy and vampirism, and their ability to transform into animals, including wolves and ravens. Historically linked to the Druids of Galen, the Glenmoril Wyrd broke away due to differing philosophies, choosing to live as reclusive protectors of the wilds. They see themselves as part of nature itself, drawing their power from the land and maintaining a delicate balance between life and death.  The covens are spread across regions such as High Rock, Skyrim, and Bangkorai, each with distinct beliefs and practices. While many covens venerate Hircine, others align with Daedric Princes like Namira or Molag Bal, creating both alliances and rivalries with groups like the Reachmen. The Glenmoril Wyrd has been influential in major events throughout history, such as assisting in the Bloodmoon Prophecy on Solstheim and making a pact with the Companions of Whiterun that introduced lycanthropy into their ranks. Over time, some covens have dwindled, such as the hagraven-led Glenmoril witches in Falkreath Hold, who became the last of their kind in Skyrim by the Fourth Era.

Before the establishment of the Arcane University, the Crystal Tower was regarded as the foremost center of magical learning in Tamriel, featuring a radiant white interior that housed a Great Library and a treasury filled with ancient relics, including maps attributed to Topal the Pilot. Additionally, it was famous for The Bestiary, a collection of dangerous creatures cared for by trolls.  As one of the legendary Towers that help stabilize the Mundus, the Crystal Tower existed concurrently across all realms of the Aurbis, functioning as a gateway to various realities.

This curse led to the recurring Greymarch, during which Jyggalag would briefly reclaim his form before reverting back to Sheogorath.  Sheogorath is revered and feared in many cultures, especially among the Khajiit, who call him the Skooma Cat, and the Dunmer, who regard him as one of the Four Corners of the House of Troubles.

Torygg respected Ulfric''s passionate stance and sought to engage him in dialogue about his views, unaware that Ulfric had come with the intention of challenging him for the throne.  The encounter between Torygg and Ulfric culminated in tragedy, as Ulfric used his thu''um to overpower the young king and subsequently killed him.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('mannimarco', 'Mannimarco, known as the God of Worms and founder of the Order of the Black Worm, is one of the most infamous figures in Tamrielic history. Originally an Altmer (or Aldmer by his own claim) and a member of the Psijic Order on Artaeum, Mannimarco''s dark fascination with necromancy led to his expulsion after his practices horrified his peers, including his former friend Vanus Galerion, who later founded the Mages Guild. This exile marked the beginning of Mannimarco''s ascent into infamy as he gathered followers and became the world''s first lich, earning the title "King of Worms." His mastery of necromancy allowed him to tap into forbidden arts, consorting with Daedra like Molag Bal and creating vile artifacts such as the Necromancer''s Amulet and the Staff of Worms. Mannimarco''s influence spread across Tamriel through his cult, the Worm Cult, which orchestrated political schemes and dark rituals, including the catastrophic Soulburst during the Planemeld.  Mannimarco''s pursuit of power culminated during the Warp in the West, a mysterious event in which he achieved apotheosis, transforming into a divine being embodied by the Necromancer''s Moon, also known as the Revenant. Despite this ascension, Mannimarco maintained a tangible presence in Tamriel, clashing with the Mages Guild and other enemies, such as the Hero of Kvatch, who destroyed his mortal form in 3E 433. His divine legacy, however, persisted, as the Necromancer''s Moon continued to empower his followers, allowing them to corrupt soul gems and perpetuate his dark influence. Through his artifacts, rituals, and the enduring shadow of his cult, Mannimarco remains an enduring figure of dread in Tamriel, a symbol of the dangerous allure of necromancy and the pursuit of immortality at any cost.', '''3e'':226B ''433'':227B ''achiev'':178B ''across'':138B ''after'':56B ''aldmer'':32B ''allow'':106B ''allowing'':243B ''allur'':279B ''also'':191B ''altmer'':30B ''amulet'':128B ''an'':29B,267B ''and'':9B,37B,89B,119B,129B,150B,211B,249B,258B,282B ''any'':288B ''apotheosis'':179B ''artaeum'':45B ''artifacts'':122B,256B ''arts'':112B ''as'':4B,85B,124B,193B,215B,233B ''ascension'':198B ''ascent'':82B ''at'':287B ''bal'':118B ''becam'':90B ''beginning'':78B ''being'':184B ''black'':16B ''by'':33B,186B ''catastrophic'':155B ''claim'':36B ''clashing'':206B ''consorting'':113B ''continu'':238B ''corrupt'':246B ''cost'':289B ''creating'':120B ''culminat'':165B ''cult'':142B,145B,264B ''daedr'':115B ''dangerous'':278B ''dark'':48B,151B,252B ''despit'':196B ''destroy'':221B ''divin'':183B,229B ''dre'':271B ''during'':157B,166B ''earning'':96B ''embodi'':185B ''empow'':240B ''enduring'':260B,268B ''enemi'':213B ''event'':174B ''exil'':75B ''expulsion'':55B ''fascination'':49B ''figur'':24B,269B ''first'':94B ''followers'':88B,242B ''forbidd'':111B ''form'':64B,224B ''found'':10B,70B ''friend'':65B ''galerion'':67B ''gather'':87B ''gems'':248B ''god'':6B ''guild'':73B,210B ''her'':217B ''him'':107B ''his'':34B,54B,57B,60B,63B,102B,141B,222B,228B,241B,251B,255B,263B ''history'':27B ''horrifi'':59B ''howev'':231B ''immortality'':286B ''in'':25B,169B,175B,204B,225B,272B ''including'':62B,153B ''infamous'':23B ''infamy'':84B ''influenc'':136B,253B ''into'':83B,110B,181B ''is'':18B ''king'':99B ''known'':3B,192B ''kvatch'':219B ''lat'':69B ''led'':52B ''legacy'':230B ''lich'':95B ''lik'':116B ''mag'':72B,209B ''maintain'':200B ''mannimarc'':1A,2B,46B,80B,134B,160B,199B,265B ''mark'':76B ''mastery'':103B ''memb'':39B ''molag'':117B ''moon'':190B,237B ''mortal'':223B ''most'':22B ''mysterious'':173B ''necromanc'':126B,188B,235B ''necromancy'':51B,105B,281B ''of'':7B,11B,14B,20B,40B,79B,100B,104B,132B,163B,218B,262B,270B,276B,280B,285B ''on'':44B ''one'':19B ''or'':31B ''orchestrat'':147B ''order'':13B,43B ''originally'':28B ''other'':212B ''own'':35B ''peers'':61B ''perpetuat'':250B ''persist'':232B ''planemeld'':159B ''political'':148B ''pow'':164B ''practic'':58B ''presenc'':203B ''psijic'':42B ''pursuit'':162B,284B ''remains'':266B ''revenant'':195B ''rituals'':152B,257B ''s'':47B,81B,93B,127B,135B,161B,189B,236B ''schem'':149B ''shadow'':261B ''soul'':247B ''soulburst'':156B ''spre'':137B ''staff'':131B ''such'':123B,214B ''symbol'':275B ''tamriel'':139B,205B,273B ''tamrielic'':26B ''tangibl'':202B ''tap'':109B ''the'':5B,12B,15B,21B,41B,71B,77B,91B,97B,125B,130B,143B,154B,158B,167B,170B,187B,194B,208B,216B,234B,259B,277B,283B ''them'':244B ''this'':74B,197B ''through'':140B,254B ''titl'':98B ''to'':53B,108B,239B,245B ''transforming'':180B ''vanus'':66B ''vil'':121B ''warp'':168B ''west'':171B ''which'':146B,176B ''who'':68B,220B ''with'':50B,114B,207B ''world'':92B ''worm'':17B,144B ''worms'':8B,101B,133B');

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('hist', 'The Hist are ancient, sentient spore trees found primarily in the swamps of Black Marsh, revered by the Argonians as both their creators and spiritual guides. Often referred to as "people of the root," Argonians share a profound bond with the Hist, symbolized through rituals involving the consumption of their sap, which grants visions and strengthens this connection. The Hist are believed to predate all mortal races, surviving the catastrophic wars of the Ehlnofey. Their collective consciousness spans across Nirn, allowing them to act as one entity, though rogue Hist, like the one in Lilmoth, occasionally sever this bond. The Hist are pivotal to Argonian life, nurturing their eggs during hatching rituals and guiding their culture through mystical communion, dreams, and visions. Marsh-born Argonians wield Hist-specific magic and are deeply tied to their roots, whereas those hatched outside Black Marsh, known as lukiul, often struggle to hear the Hist''s voice.  Legends surrounding the Hist highlight their role in major historical events, such as the Oblivion Crisis, where they rallied Argonians to invade Mehrunes Dagon''s realms, leading to a decisive victory. The Hist are also known for their strange artifacts and manifestations, such as the Dreaming Tree, which preserved the souls of an Argonian tribe during an Ayleid invasion, and the Sleeping Tree in Skyrim, speculated to be a "cousin" of the Hist from Oblivion. Hist sap, a potent and mystical substance, is capable of altering living beings, enhancing combat abilities, and even creating dangerous bloodlust when consumed improperly.

Initially, this sect revered dragons as divine beings, particularly associating their worship with Akatosh, the chief deity among the Divines. As a result, dragons held a position of supremacy over mankind, with dragon priests serving as their powerful intermediaries, enforcing laws and maintaining order in society. Temples were erected to honor these dragons, many of which remain as draugr-infested ruins today.  However, over time, the Dragon Cult became increasingly oppressive, establishing their capital at Bromjunaar in what is now Hjaalmarch and effectively enslaving the Nordic populace. This shift in demeanor is believed to have been influenced by Alduin, the First-Born of Akatosh, who sought to dominate Mundus. The ensuing discontent led to the ancient Dragon War, in which humans, aided by some dragons, eventually triumphed over Alduin and his cult. The dragon priests were overthrown, and the dragons were driven into hiding. Despite their fall, the Dragon Cult adapted, preserving the practice of constructing dragon mounds for the remains of fallen dragons, as they awaited the day of their return. By the First Era, the arrival of the priests of the Eight Divines further diminished the cult''s influence, leading to its eventual extinction, with the last holdouts perishing in mass suicide at Forelhost in 1E 140.', '''140'':243B ''1e'':242B ''adapt'':185B ''aid'':156B ''akatosh'':46B,138B ''alduin'':132B,163B ''also'':6B ''among'':50B ''ancient'':150B ''and'':74B,115B,164B,172B ''animal'':25B ''arrival'':212B ''as'':8B,20B,38B,53B,68B,90B,199B ''associating'':42B ''at'':108B,239B ''atmor'':10B ''atmorans'':30B ''await'':201B ''becam'':102B ''been'':129B ''beings'':40B ''believ'':126B ''born'':136B ''bromjun'':109B ''brought'':28B ''by'':29B,131B,157B,207B ''capital'':107B ''chief'':48B ''constructing'':190B ''cult'':2A,5B,12B,14B,101B,166B,184B,223B ''day'':203B ''deity'':49B ''demeanor'':124B ''despit'':179B ''diminish'':221B ''discontent'':146B ''divin'':39B,52B,219B ''dominat'':142B ''dragon'':1A,4B,11B,17B,65B,100B,151B,168B,183B,191B ''dragons'':37B,56B,85B,159B,174B,198B ''draugr'':92B ''draugr-infest'':91B ''driv'':176B ''effectively'':116B ''eight'':218B ''enforcing'':72B ''enslaving'':117B ''ensuing'':145B ''erect'':81B ''establishing'':105B ''eventual'':229B ''eventually'':160B ''extinction'':230B ''fall'':181B,197B ''first'':135B,209B ''first-born'':134B ''for'':193B ''forelhost'':240B ''furth'':220B ''hav'':128B ''held'':57B ''hiding'':178B ''his'':165B ''hjaalmarch'':114B ''holdouts'':234B ''honor'':83B ''howev'':96B ''humans'':155B ''in'':77B,110B,123B,153B,236B,241B ''increasingly'':103B ''infest'':93B ''influenc'':130B,225B ''initially'':33B ''intermediari'':71B ''into'':177B ''is'':112B,125B ''its'':228B ''known'':7B ''last'':233B ''laws'':73B ''leading'':226B ''led'':147B ''maintaining'':75B ''mankind'':63B ''many'':86B ''mass'':237B ''mounds'':192B ''mundus'':143B ''nordic'':119B ''now'':113B ''of'':15B,60B,87B,137B,189B,196B,204B,213B,216B ''oppressiv'':104B ''or'':13B ''order'':76B ''originat'':19B ''over'':62B,97B,162B ''overthrown'':171B ''particularly'':41B ''perishing'':235B ''populac'':120B ''position'':59B ''powerful'':70B ''practic'':188B ''preserving'':186B ''priests'':18B,66B,169B,215B ''remain'':89B ''remains'':195B ''result'':55B ''return'':206B ''rever'':36B ''ruins'':94B ''s'':224B ''sect'':22B,35B ''serving'':67B ''shift'':122B ''society'':78B ''som'':158B ''sought'':140B ''suicid'':238B ''supremacy'':61B ''tamriel'':32B ''templ'':79B ''the'':3B,9B,16B,24B,43B,47B,51B,69B,99B,106B,118B,133B,144B,149B,167B,173B,180B,182B,187B,194B,202B,205B,208B,211B,214B,217B,222B,232B ''thes'':84B ''they'':200B ''this'':34B,121B ''tim'':98B ''to'':31B,82B,127B,141B,148B,227B ''today'':95B ''traditions'':27B ''triumph'':161B ''war'':152B ''wer'':80B,170B,175B ''what'':111B ''which'':88B,154B ''who'':139B ''with'':45B,64B,231B ''within'':23B ''worship'':26B,44B');

The Night of Tears, a tragic event in which the Snow Elves attacked the human settlement of Saarthal, is often attributed to tensions between the two races. While some Elven scholars claim that Ysgramor''s actions provoked this attack, many believe it was unprovoked, resulting in the massacre of most humans in the settlement, save for Ysgramor and his two sons, Yngol and Ylgar. After fleeing to Atmora, Ysgramor returned with the legendary Five Hundred Companions and launched a campaign against the Elves, successfully driving them from Skyrim and Solstheim. Wielding the axe Wuuthrad and accompanied by a Storm Atronach Bear summoned by his Clever Man, Alabar the Oddly-Colored, Ysgramor solidified his status as a cultural hero of the Nords.  Ysgramor is also credited with being the first human historian, having transcribed Nordic speech using Elven writing principles. His legacy endures through the Companions, who regard him as their true leader, and his descendants ruled Skyrim until the death of King Borgas in 1E 369, marking the end of his direct lineage.

Although specific details of Aldmer culture remain elusive, they were known for their chivalric high culture and musical traditions. Notable figures from Aldmer history include High Lord Torinaan, who established the Summerset Isles, and Topal the Pilot, who explored much of Tamriel. The modern Altmer are believed to closely resemble their Aldmer ancestors and strive to emulate their ways, even going so far as to selectively breed for traits associated with the original Aldmer. The term "Aldmeri" is often used to refer collectively to all elves or to denote members of the Aldmeri community.', '''across'':71B ''advanc'':37B ''aldmer'':3B,48B,103B,121B,150B,172B ''aldmeri'':1A,175B,191B ''aldmeris'':60B ''all'':183B ''although'':41B,99B ''altmer'':89B,143B ''among'':66B ''ancestors'':151B ''and'':21B,97B,115B,132B,152B ''are'':10B,31B,49B,144B ''as'':33B,59B,68B,162B ''associat'':168B ''ayleids'':93B ''beings'':38B ''believ'':145B ''bosm'':90B ''bre'':165B ''chim'':92B ''chivalric'':112B ''claim'':43B ''closely'':147B ''collectively'':181B ''community'':192B ''contest'':46B ''continent'':57B ''cultur'':104B,114B ''debat'':65B ''denot'':187B ''details'':101B ''distinct'':83B ''during'':26B ''dwem'':91B ''elder'':8B ''elusiv'':106B ''elves'':79B,95B,184B ''emulat'':155B ''establish'':128B ''even'':158B ''evolv'':74B ''explor'':137B ''far'':161B ''figur'':119B ''first'':5B,35B ''folk'':6B,9B ''for'':110B,166B ''from'':54B,120B ''going'':159B ''groups'':84B ''hav'':52B ''having'':16B ''high'':113B,124B ''history'':122B ''in'':18B ''includ'':123B ''including'':87B ''inhabitants'':13B ''into'':75B ''is'':44B,63B,176B ''isle'':20B ''isles'':131B ''known'':58B,85B,109B ''leading'':80B ''lord'':125B ''mainland'':25B ''maorm'':96B ''meaning'':4B ''members'':188B ''merethic'':28B ''modern'':142B ''much'':22B,138B ''musical'':116B ''mythical'':56B ''nirn'':40B ''notabl'':118B ''of'':14B,23B,78B,102B,139B,189B ''often'':177B ''on'':39B ''or'':7B,185B ''orcs'':98B ''original'':12B,171B ''originat'':53B ''pilot'':135B ''ref'':180B ''regard'':32B ''remain'':105B ''resembl'':148B ''said'':50B ''scholars'':67B ''selectively'':164B ''settl'':17B ''snow'':94B ''so'':160B ''sometim'':45B ''specific'':100B ''spre'':70B ''striv'':153B ''summerset'':19B,130B ''tamriel'':15B,72B,140B ''technologically'':36B ''term'':174B ''the'':2B,11B,24B,27B,34B,47B,82B,88B,111B,129B,134B,141B,149B,156B,170B,173B,190B ''they'':30B,69B,73B,107B ''this'':42B,62B ''though'':61B ''to'':51B,81B,146B,154B,163B,179B,182B,186B ''today'':86B ''topal'':133B ''torin'':126B ''traditions'':117B ''traits'':167B ''types'':77B ''used'':178B ''various'':76B ''ways'':157B ''wer'':108B ''who'':127B,136B ''widely'':64B ''with'':169B');

Led by the Slave-Queen Alessia, the rebellion marked the liberation of the Nedic people from their Ayleid overlords, who had dominated Cyrodiil through a brutal regime of Daedra worship, enslavement, and ritual cruelty. With divine guidance from the Eight Divines and the aid of key allies like Pelinal Whitestrake and Morihaus, Alessia united human slaves and sympathetic Ayleid factions in a desperate uprising. The rebellion culminated in the Siege of White-Gold Tower, where Pelinal slew the demigod Umaril the Unfeathered but fell in battle. This victory dismantled the Ayleid Empire and laid the foundation for the Alessian Empire, ushering in the dominance of men over mer in Cyrodiil.  The rebellion not only freed the Nedic slaves but also began the Ayleids'' gradual decline. Many Daedra-worshipping Ayleids fled to Valenwood and High Rock, while their remaining city-states either integrated into the new Empire as vassals or were annihilated by the Alessian forces. The rebellion’s aftermath saw Alessia crowned as the first Empress of Cyrodiil, the establishment of the Amulet of Kings to protect Mundus from Oblivion, and the rise of the Imperial Pantheon, blending elements of Nordic and Elven faiths. However, centuries later, the rise of the Alessian Order would erase much of the Ayleid presence from Cyrodiil, ensuring the once-mighty Heartland High Elves faded into obscurity.

This period is characterized by the power struggles and fragmentation of Tamriel''s kingdoms, alongside the emergence of notable organizations such as the Mages Guild and the Dark Brotherhood.

The assassination of Versidue-Shaie in 2E 324 marked a turning point, leading to the dissolution of the Second Empire and the fragmentation of Imperial authority.  A notable conflict during this era was Varen''s Rebellion in 2E 576, sparked by Emperor Leovic''s controversial legalization of Daedra worship. Varen Aquilarios, the leader of the rebellion, eventually took the throne but was lost in the chaos of the Soulburst in 2E 578, an event that unleashed Daedric forces upon Nirn.  The Second Era also saw the formation of the Aldmeri Dominion, the Ebonheart Pact, and the Daggerfall Covenant, which clashed in the Three Banners War for control of the Ruby Throne. The era concluded with Tiber Septim''s unification of Tamriel in 2E 896, marking the rise of the Third Empire and the end of the Second Era.

The crisis was ignited by the assassination of Emperor Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, leading to the opening of Oblivion Gates across the continent, through which Daedra emerged in overwhelming numbers. These gates were facilitated by the Mythic Dawn, a fanatical cult devoted to Mehrunes Dagon, resulting in widespread devastation throughout various provinces. Key regions such as Skyrim faced brutal sieges, while Kvatch in Cyrodiil was completely destroyed. The Argonians of Black Marsh, called upon by the Hist, mounted a successful counter-offensive against the Daedra, forcing them to close their gates in that region.  Despite the turmoil, the Empire struggled to maintain order, with significant forces withdrawn from provinces like Morrowind, leaving Cyrodiil largely defenseless.

It was triggered by the death of King Lysandus of Daggerfall, leading to an upheaval in the regions of Hammerfell and High Rock. This phenomenon is often likened to a Dragon Break, reminiscent of the Middle Dawn from the First Era, although its effects were localized to the Iliac Bay.  Central to the Warp was the Totem of Tiber Septim, an ancient artifact that allowed its wielder to control the colossal war machine known as Numidium. An unknown hero, believed to be an agent of the Blades, acquired the Totem, igniting a fierce competition among various factions, including Sentinel, Wayrest, Daggerfall, and Orsinium, all vying for its power. Following a series of mysterious cataclysms, the political landscape of the Iliac Bay dramatically shifted from forty-four city-states to just four, all of which pledged loyalty to the Emperor. The Warp also had far-reaching consequences, with figures like Mannimarco utilizing the Totem for personal ascendance, while the Underking reclaimed his lost heart from Numidium, creating an expansive anti-magic zone around the area.

Originally hailing from Cyrodiil, he was appointed as the Military Governor of the region and viewed Ulfric Stormcloak as a dangerous usurper whose actions posed a significant threat to the Empire.

Initially dismissive of Nordic culture, he eventually came to respect it, recognizing its importance in the context of the conflict.  In 4E 201, Tullius nearly executed both Ulfric Stormcloak and the Last Dragonborn during a critical moment before the dragon Alduin''s attack on Helgen.

The term "Dwemer" translates to "the Deep" or "Deep-Counseled," reflecting their secretive nature. While they were regarded affectionately by the Giant races, who referred to them as "Dwarves," the Dwemer''s true nature was far more complex, characterized by their intelligence, reclusiveness, and often ruthless demeanor.

The Dwemer were known for their rigorous pursuit of knowledge in science, engineering, and the arcane, operating in clans that valued free thought. Their society, however, came to an abrupt end around 1E 700, leading to numerous theories about their disappearance, none of which have been definitively proven.

His legendary conquests culminated in the subjugation of the Aldmeri Dominion, leading to his later veneration by humans as the "Hero-God of Mankind." Upon his death in 3E 38, Tiber Septim is believed to have ascended to become the ninth Divine, joining the pantheon of the Eight Divines as Talos.  Talos is revered as the patron of warriors, adventurers, and rulers, symbolizing the virtues of strength, courage, and leadership. His divine status, however, is a point of contention, especially among the Altmer, who view his apotheosis with hostility due to his conquest of their lands. In the Fourth Era, worship of Talos was banned following the White-Gold Concordat between the Aldmeri Dominion and the Empire, which claimed that a man could not achieve godhood.

Grand temples were constructed to honor the dragons, and dragon priests were granted power in exchange for ruling humanity on their behalf. However, this balance of power shifted as the dragon priests grew tyrannical, enslaving the population and demanding absolute obedience. When rebellion broke out, the dragons retaliated with devastating force, sparking the Dragon War.  Initially, humanity suffered immense losses, but the tide shifted when certain dragons sided with men. It is said that from these traitorous dragons, men learned powerful magics, possibly with the intervention of Akatosh, allowing them to combat their former overlords. Over time, the dragon priests were overthrown, and dragons were hunted to near extinction.

He was known for his strength and leadership, often depicted holding his sword, Penitent (Vosh Rakh, the "Blade of Courage"). Trinimac was especially venerated by the Altmer, Ayleids, and early Orcs, and was regarded as a god who stood for strength, honor, and unity. However, his legacy is deeply entwined with his transformation into Malacath, a Daedric Prince, after an encounter with Boethiah.  According to legend, Boethiah consumed Trinimac and took on his form to spread new teachings among the Aldmer, leading to the creation of the Chimer and Orcs. Boethiah''s act of devouring Trinimac resulted in his followers transforming into the Orsimer (Orcs), and Trinimac himself was reborn as Malacath, a weaker and vengeful version of his former self. While many Orcs continued to worship Malacath, others maintained belief in the purity of Trinimac. During the Second Era, leaders like King Kurog and King Gortwog revived the worship of Trinimac, positioning him as a god of unity and civilization, in contrast to the savage nature associated with Malacath.

This concept, believed to be from the ancient Ehlnofex language, represents royalty, splendor, and starlight. Reaching CHIM involves a profound realization of the universe’s nature and one''s place within it, leading to an understanding of the entire scope of existence while maintaining a firm grasp on individuality. Those who achieve CHIM are rumored to possess the ability to reshape the world, with some legends claiming that Tiber Septim used this power to transform Cyrodiil from an endless jungle into a temperate land.  The process of attaining CHIM is one of the six "Walking Ways" to divinity.
